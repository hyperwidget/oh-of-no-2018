Advent of Code stuff I guess

Start off with `npm i`

To dev: `npm run dev`,

Start of with putting the day's inputs and answers into the tests directory

then `node ./dist/runner.js day1 a test`
To test against your example answers

and

or `node ./dist/runner.js day1 a process`
to test with the question's input
